# Very short presentation about Julia

View the presentation in a [static mode](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mmider/mpi_about_julia/blob/master/julia_presentation.ipynb) or in an interactive mode by clicking this button [![binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mmider/mpi_about_julia/master) and selecting `julia_presentation.ipynb` from the list of notebooks. In the interactive mode you have access to the Julia kernel, so you can change the code and run your own functions...

Unfortunately I managed to have an old Julia kernel running in the browser, so if you rum the intervactive session using `binder`, then some packages and functionality will be unavailable...

`julia_presentation_v1.ipynb` is the same notebook as the one I used during the presentation (I originally wrote the presentation for Julia v1.3 and some functions are not available in the online kernel of Julia v0.6.4, so the interactive kernel is slightly different).
